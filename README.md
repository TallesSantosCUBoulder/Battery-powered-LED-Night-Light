LED Night Light - Educational Project

The LED Night Light is a compact, energy-efficient device that provides gentle illumination during nighttime. It automatically turns on in darkness and off in bright conditions using a photoresistor (LDR) in a voltage divider circuit. This project demonstrates fundamental electronics concepts such as current-limiting resistors, voltage dividers, and sensor-based control, bridging theory and practical application for students in the CU Boulder / CMU Partnership Program.

The circuit can be first assembled on a breadboard for prototyping and testing. Components include resistors, LEDs, a photoresistor, a battery, and jumper wires. This hands-on step allows students to understand circuit design, verify connections, and observe LED behavior under different lighting conditions.

After testing, the design can be transferred to a PCB (printed circuit board) for a more permanent, reliable solution. Students assemble the PCB without soldering, bending component leads into pre-designed holes. This approach teaches PCB layout, assembly skills, and practical electronics handling.

Overall, this project combines theoretical knowledge with hands-on experience, helping students learn about semiconductors, sensors, energy conversion, and circuit fundamentals while building a functional, real-world device.
