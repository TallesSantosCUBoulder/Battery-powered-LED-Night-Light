# Battery-Powered LED Night Light

As part of my classes in the **CU Boulder / CMU Partnership Program**, students were challenged to design and build a **Battery-Powered LED Night Light** circuit.  
This activity combined theoretical knowledge with practical circuit design skills, providing students with hands-on experience in electronics assembly and testing.

The project also served a special purpose beyond the classroom.  
Students designed the LED night light as a **souvenir for future students**, especially high school visitors interested in engineering.  
Each group first built and tested the circuit on a breadboard, then transferred it to a printed circuit board (PCB) for a permanent and professional versionâ€”promoting technical learning, creativity, and teamwork within the CU Boulder / CMU Partnership Program.
